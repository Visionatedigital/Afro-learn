# Technical Architecture
- Modular React frontend (web/mobile)
- AI backend (OpenAI, local LLM, or custom)
- Voice-to-text and text-to-speech integration
- Content schema for cultural/localization tagging
- Offline-first data model and caching
- Gamification and progress tracking modules
- Parent/teacher dashboard modules

# Development Roadmap
## MVP Requirements
- AfroBuddy chat UI (voice + text)
- Basic AI tutor integration (Socratic, hint-based)
- Culturally relevant content library (names, stories, analogies)
- Parent dashboard: progress report, tips
- Teacher dashboard: class progress, lesson generator
- Progress tracker and streaks
- Mobile-first UI

## Future Enhancements
- Animated AfroBuddy and interactive illustrations
- Multilingual support (Swahili, Luganda, Yoruba, etc.)
- Downloadable/offline lesson packages
- Advanced gamification (quests, unlockables)
- Teacher lesson planning AI
- Parent AI tutor for home support

# Logical Dependency Chain
- Foundation: AfroBuddy chat UI, AI integration, content schema
- Progress tracker and dashboards
- Gamification and cultural content
- Offline/low-data mode
- Advanced features (animation, multilingual, lesson planning)

# Risks and Mitigations
- Voice tech reliability: Use fallback to text, test on low-end devices
- Content/cultural accuracy: Involve local educators, advisors
- Data privacy: Strict compliance, local storage for offline
- Bandwidth: Optimize assets, offer offline/cached modes

# Appendix
- Research: Khanmigo, ChatGPT, LearnLM feature analysis
- Technical: Library options for voice, offline, gamification
- User feedback: Pilot with students/teachers/parents
