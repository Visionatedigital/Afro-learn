# AfroLearn Personalized Learning Dashboard: Phased Plan

## Vision
AfroLearn aims to be Africa’s home for smart, inclusive learning—empowering children across all 54 countries with accessible, culturally relevant education.

---

## Phased Task Breakdown

### 1. User Onboarding/Profile Flow
- Design and implement onboarding with country, grade, and language selection at signup.
- Update backend and AuthContext to store and provide this info.

### 2. Personalized Learning Dashboard UI
- Build dashboard to show:
  - Core subjects (math, science, literacy)
  - Country-specific content (history, social studies)
  - Cultural/life skills sections (proverbs, folktales, values)
- Personalize based on user profile.

### 3. Content Schema & Management
- Create content schema and tagging system (subject, country, grade, language).
- Build a simple content management interface for adding and managing content.

### 4. Localization & Language Support
- Implement i18n for the platform, starting with English and one additional language (e.g., French or Swahili).

### 5. Seed with Pilot Content
- Add core math/science modules and country-specific social studies/folktales for 1–2 countries.

## Roadmap Example
| Phase | Action |
|-------|--------|
| 1     | Launch MVP: onboarding, dashboard, core subjects (English only) |
| 2     | Add local folktales and country-specific social studies for 5–10 nations |
| 3     | Add language support (French, Arabic), onboard educators |
| 4     | Scale to 30–40 countries with modular social studies per country |

---

## Notes
- Start with a few pilot countries and expand gradually.
- Involve local educators and cultural advisors for content accuracy.
- Build for low-bandwidth/offline use where possible.
